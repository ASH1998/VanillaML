## VanillaML
VanillaML contains a collection of my implementations of standard machine learning techniques. All implementations
are made to be as simple as possible. That said, there are no bells and whistles to speed up model's performance
for production usage.

The implementations follows the API conventions of scikit-learn.

## Requirements
* Python 2.7
* numpy, matplotlib which can be installed via

```
$ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Implemented algorithms
