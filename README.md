# VanillaML
VanillaML contains a collection of my implementations of standard machine learning algorithms. 

All implementations are made to be as simple as possible. That said, there are no bells and whistles to 
speed up model's performance for production usage. The implementations follows scikit-learn's API conventions.

## Requirements
* Python 2.7
* Numpy and matplotlib which can be installed via:

```
$ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```
